# Lab instructions

## Skill 1 - working with gulp
* experiment with ``gulp clean`` and ``gulp serve``
* analyze the differences in folders generated by ``gulp serve`` and ``gulp build``
* add a dependency to a bower library like https://github.com/angular-ui/bower-ui-grid
* upgrade to the latest version of angular

## Skill 2 - creating functional modules
In src/app
* add a folder and html ruleconfiguration page for the ExpenseRulesConfiguration module

* create a form for entering expenses in employee/employee-insert.html and a corresponding ExpenseInsertController

Also, upgrade the existing modules: 
* add an approval page to the backoffice module

## Skill 3 - configuring routing in modules
* define the rules.module.js and inizialize the module
* create rules.route.js
* add a link to the configuration sectino in the main menu

## Skill 4 - module and routing review
* add folder, html, module and routing for the Payments module

## Skill 5 - creating a reusable service (in an utility module)
* create an ExpenseValidationService which a validateExpense(expense) method that checks that 
  * the key required fields are present
  * the date of the expense is in the past
  * the amount is in a configurable range
* put it into a expense-validation folder, creating a corresponding module

## Skill 6 - testing  a reusable service (in an utility module)
* implement a unit testing for the service ExpenseValidationService, manually creating various Expense objects and testing
  * wrong expenses
  * valid expenses
  * expenses in the future

## Skill 7 - testing a controller
* create a unit test for the ExpenseInsertController
* create a unit test for the ExpenseApprovalController

* add formatting to the DataTable component
* add parameters for enabling / disabling sorting of the table columns
* add a refresh button inside the datatable, which triggers an on-refresh event
* manage the on-refresh event in the surrounding controller

* try re-implementing the grid component using ui-grid

## Skill 10 - designing an application in modules
* try designing in detail the structure of the other modules

* try designing a new application and splitting it in modules. Examples: 
  * a webmail
  * a timesheet
  * an ecommerce website
